# React + Vite

"The drag files card website is a fun and interactive site where you can easily move files around by dragging them. It's built using React.js with Vite for quick development. When you drag a file, it bounces around playfully, making it more enjoyable to use. This bouncing effect is created using Framer Motion, a tool for making smooth animations in React. Overall, it's a user-friendly way to organize your files!"
